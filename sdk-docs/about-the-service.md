Flow Automation is a generic workflow-based automation framework and application. It allows designers to automate tasks through the use of Flows.

In addition, Flow Automation provides a suite of components. For example:

* Flow User Tasks which allow flows to interact with users
* Flow Execution Report which can present output of flow execution to users
* Flow API and Flow Java Libraries which can be used to implement low level logic in combination with Flow Scripting
